# pizzaclassification

This project classifies the pizzas of two types. Below are the explanation of what each file does

data_preparation: It prepares the data and saves them into numpy arrays
keras_cnn_1.ipynb: It is a keras based cnn+dnn classifier neural network
tf_cnn.ipynb: It is a core tensorflow implementation of cnn + dnn classifier. Need to incorporate batch normalization and color scapes
retrain.py: File to retrain the images from inception net
predict_image.ipynb: This file is used to predict the unseen images from retrain.py model output
